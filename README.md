# Rebab Metrics

Rehab Metrics is a post-surgery rehabilitation tracking tool that helps patients monitor their recovery progress, with a particular focus on knee rehabilitation. Built in Python and deployed via Code Institute's Heroku terminal, the app features secure user registration and login with validation for usernames and passwords. Users enter their details, and the app calculates their stage in the rehabilitation journey, providing feedback on pain levels, knee range of motion, and weight bearing status. All data is securely stored using Google Sheets integration. Rehab Metrics is intended as a supportive self-monitoring tool and includes prompts to consult a healthcare professional when needed, as it does not provide medical advice.

## Project Plan

### Project Goals
I developed Rehab Metrics inspired by a close relative who recently underwent a knee replacement. They had many questions about their recovery, particularly around the expected timeline and what level of movement and activity they should be achieving in the first few months. This app aims to provide clear, stage appropriate guidance to help users monitor their progress and feel more confident during their recovery. From this experience, I realised I could create a project that collects user data and provides advice on key areas of recovery, helping patients understand their progress and what to expect during rehabilitation.

## User Stories

### Target Audience

The target audience for Rehab Metrics is people who have recently undergone knee surgery and want to track their recovery progress.

### First Time Visitor Goals

As a first-time user, I want to:

* Easily navigate the application and understand its purpose
* Enter my personal and surgery details
* Have a record of my details that provides feedback on my progress

### Returning Visitor Goals

As a returning user, I want to:

* Log in securely with my username
* Enter my password to protect my information
* Review my previously entered details and progress

### Site Owner Goals
As the creator of Rehab Metrics, my goal is to develop an intuitive and accessible rehabilitation tracking tool for individuals recovering from knee surgery. I aim to:

* Create a user-friendly interface that avoids medical jargon.
* Ask clear, structured questions that users can easily understand and respond to.
* Convert the user's input into approximate, meaningful feedback about their stage of recovery.
* Store data securely using Google Sheets.
* Allow returning users to retrieve their previous entries by logging in with a username and password.
* The focus is to provide reassurance and progress tracking during a crucial recovery period.

### Structure of the program
At the start of the project, I created a draft flowchart to visualise the program's intended structure. I had a clear end goal in mind, outlining the key questions and the type of data I aimed to collect and store using Google Sheets.

The early flow focused on capturing user information and guiding them through recover related questions:

As the project progressed, I refined the flow to include input validation and safety checks to improve the user experience. The final algorithm shows the outcome for new and existing users:
