# Rebab Metrics

Rehab Metrics is a post-surgery rehabilitation tracking tool that helps patients monitor their recovery progress, with a particular focus on knee rehabilitation. Built in Python and deployed via Code Institute's Heroku terminal, the app features secure user registration and login with validation for usernames and passwords. Users enter their details, and the app calculates their stage in the rehabilitation journey, providing feedback on pain levels, knee range of motion, and weight bearing status. All data is securely stored using Google Sheets integration. Rehab Metrics is intended as a supportive self-monitoring tool and includes prompts to consult a healthcare professional when needed, as it does not provide medical advice.

## Project Plan

### Project Goals
I developed Rehab Metrics inspired by a close relative who recently underwent a knee replacement. They had many questions about their recovery, particularly around the expected timeline and what level of movement and activity they should be achieving in the first few months. This app aims to provide clear, stage appropriate guidance to help patients monitor their progress and feel more confident during their recovery. From this experience, I realised I could create a project that collects user data and provides advice on key areas of recovery, helping patients understand their progress and what to expect during rehabilitation.
